# Data_Analytics_in_HPC_Security
The goal of this project is to understand the progression of a multi-stage attack that aims to leak secret keys from the target system. In this project, data analysis of a multi-stage attack is recreated from publicly available information on the Equifax breach. Use of signature-based, anomaly-based, and factor graph-based analysis techniques is explored.
